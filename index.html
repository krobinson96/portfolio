        <h1>About Kody</h1>
        <h3>What do you do?</h3>
        <p>
          Some would describe me as a person with many interests; I would describe myself as someone who wants to understand. When I am not typing away on a keyboard, I try to immerse myself into either the world around me or one of the many interests I have. Some of them include cooking, typography, philosophy and agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student at Thinkful, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If you're looking to hire a budding new developer (or are looking for a hackathon partner,) please reach out! I am excited to work with other developers of any level to create some great software.
