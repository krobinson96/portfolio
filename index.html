      <article>About Kody</article>
      <p>
        As far as I can remember, I have always used a computer to my benefit. After taking multiple classes centered around computers, I began to realize that I had a passion for computers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a student at Thinkful, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking to hire a budding new developer (or are looking for a hackathon partner,) please reach out! I am excited to work with other developers of any level to create some great software.
      </p>
